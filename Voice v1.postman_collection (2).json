Please note, Exotel will cache the wav file. During the first few call attempts of setting this parameter, user might hear normal ringing tone for first 5 seconds (for a ~2MB file). This is only temporary for initial few calls and once the audio file is cached, audio will be played out smoothly.\nIn case you decide to change the audio file later, the WaitUrl should be different (as Exotel will cache audio file based on URL). You can do so by hosting the audio file with a different name.\nWhen using this parameter, it is recommended to set the TimeOut parameter as well.\nExample: \"http://{your_hosted_endpoint}/{audio file name}.wav\"",
